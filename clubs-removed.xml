    <b>From the M25 Westbound</b> (anticlockwise) exit at Jct 22, go straight across the roundabout into the B556 Bell Lane towards Radlett.
    Cross the next roundabout to continue on the B556, and after 150 yds take the first left, and continue left into the ground.
    <br/><b>From the M25 Eastbound</b> (clockwise) exit at Jct 22, at the roundabout take the 5th exit for Radlett (B556), and at the next roundabout take the
    2nd exit right into the B556 Bell Lane, and follow directions as above.
    <br/><b>From the A5183/Elstree</b> go through Elstree and Radlett (through the town centre, past the Railway station).
    On the north side of Radlett, just before a major downwards hill, turn right into the B556 Harper Lane towards Colney. After 1 1/2 miles
    go across the roundabout, and the ground is 1/2 mile on the right, just after the Pelican crossing. 
    <br/><br/><b>By Rail</b> Although the nearest train station is Radlett (reachable by Thameslink services
    from Blackfriars &amp; St Pancras), it is difficult to get transport from there to the ground, so we recommend that you go to
    St Albans station (which is one stop further on the Thameslink service).
    From here either get a Taxi (around £7 per taxi), or take the No 84 bus towards New Barnet, which runs every 20 mins, and takes about 20 mins.
    The nearest bus stop is in Alma Rd, which is right out of the station towards the City Centre, and then left at the crossroads.
    Alight at the Bell Lane stop, which is just before the road crosses over the M25 by Junction 22, and walk towards Radlett along
    Bell Lane (the B556). The grounds are signposted and about a quarter of a mile away on your left.

    <p>From M25 take J13 and head for Egham A30. Follow signs for Royal Holloway University of London
    along the A30, passing the Ferrari garage and BP station going up Egham Hill. Ignore the
    main entrance for the University, and continue to a set of lights. At the lights turn left into
    Bakeham Lane (University should now be on the left hand side). After about 300 meters the road will fork.
    Turn left here into Prune Hill, and follow this small road until just at the bottom there is a left turn into
    the Sports Centre.</p>
    <p><b>By public transport</b> take the train to Egham Station, which is linked to
    <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/WAT/EGH/saturday/1250/arr">London Waterloo</a> and
    <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/RDG/EGH/saturday/1250/arr">Reading</a>. 
    The campus is a 0.7 mile flat walk, or there is a taxi rank at the station. It is also possible to get a bus
    to the campus, however that bus stop is about a half mile walk away from the Sports Centre.</p>
    <p>Exit Egham Station onto Station Rd, by the level crossing. On the opposite side of Station Rd you'll
    see Rusham Rd immediately to the right of the train tracks. Follow this road, and take the 3rd right into
    Osborne Rd, at the end turn left into Clarence St, next right into Ripley Ave, and immediately left into
    Lynwood Ave. At the end follow the long drive to the right of the house, bearing left to follow the path
    into the rear entrance of the campus, and take the left fork down to the Sports Centre car park.</p>

    From M4: Jct 10 to A329M to Basingstoke, Follow A322 through Basingstoke to Bagshot and pick up the A30 to
    Camberley. At Camberley come to a set of traffic lights with 'The Staff' public house on the left. RMAS is
    on the right immediately after the lights.
    <br/>
    <br/>From M3: Jct 4 to A3095 Camberley. At roundabout follow A30 Camberley (London Road). This takes you along
    the southern boundary of RMAS. The entrance is about 1.5 miles along, immediately before the war memorial
    but it is set back and not easy to spot. (If you reach a set of traffic lights with 'The Staff' pub on
    your right, you have gone too far. Do not attempt to back track through the town centre, you will get
    snarled up in the One Way system. Go on to the next lights and turn right at 'The Cambridge' pub. There
    are plenty of places to turn down this road.)
