# SEMLA XML Data

Copy of all XML data files from the original South Lacrosse website in case we ever need it, for example if we've missed something in the import into new new SQL tables.

Also store the original historical data Excel file from Jon Cooper, programs to create the XML from that, as well as and the programs used to create the SQL tables from the XML.
