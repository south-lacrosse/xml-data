    right again back towards Canterbury.
    <br/>Follow this road back over the A2 for 1 mile, and at the roundabout take the 3rd exit (that's including the small exit for the pub)

    <p><b>By London Underground</b>
    <br/>The ground is under 5 minutes walk from Latimer Road station (Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, TFL Zone 2). Leave the station
    and cross the road in front of you, this is Bramley Road. Turn right and walk up Bramley Road, under the Westway flyover,

    <br/>The car parking is in the Centre's own underground car park (below the full-size football pitch)
    with the following charges (in 2019): up to 3 hours: £1.50; up to 4 hours: £2.50; up to 5 hours: £3.50.</p>
    <p><b>From the north or west</b>
    <br/>Approach along the Westway (A40). Take the exit marked Hammersmith &amp; Shepherds Bush (A3220). The road
    comes down to Holland Park Roundabout, take the first exit signed Central London.

   <note>
   <p><b>Please check game start times</b>. All three teams use the same pitch, so if more
   than one team is at home then face-off times will vary. The pitch is available to warm up half an hour 
   before face-off.</p>
   <p>If 2 teams are at home then start times are 1pm and 3pm, and for 3 teams 1pm, 3pm and 5pm (these options
   should appear in the fixtures). Normally the choice of start time is given in order of travelling
   distance of the opposition.</p>

    <p>The ground is under a mile from junction 8 of the A1(M). See also <a href="https://www.wymondleytennisclub.co.uk/directions.htm" rel="nofollow">detailed directions.</a>.
    The road up to the pitch is a little uneven so please drive carefully.</p>
    <p><b>By public transport</b> The ground is about 3 miles from both Hitchin and Stevenage Stations,
    which are on the King's Cross to Cambridge / Peterborough line, and both have taxi ranks. Hitchin Station
    is between the ground and the Cricketers, while Stevenage is in the opposite direction, but it does have
    an infrequent bus service (80 or Sapphire 101) to right outside the ground.</p>

    <p>As you enter the ground the car park is on the left as you enter the one way
    system. Go through the gate to the right of the the reception building (which is at
    the end of the one-way loop) and follow the path round past the sand astroturf until
    you see a clubhouse. The changing rooms and pitches are beyond this over the
    running track. The walk to the pitch is a little warm up in itself.</p>

    Parking in Norham Gds is residents only, or pay and display, however there is free parking on Saturdays after 1pm
    in the adjacent roads of Fyfield Rd, Crick Rd, Norham Rd and Bradmore Rd.</p>
    <p>As you enter the Parks take the right fork of the path, continue over the next path, and you will see
    the lacrosse field and the pavilion on the right.</p>
    <p>If you need to park before 1pm then you will need to pay and display, there is a machine in Norham Gdns, on the right just before Fyfield Rd.
    For details of parking charges see the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/roads-and-transport/parking/where-park/street-parking">Oxfordshire Council parking page</a>.</p>

   To get there turn left out of the ground, left at the 2nd roundabout, and left at the traffic lights,
   and the pub will be on the right.</p>
   </note>
   <directions>
    <p><b>From the M4</b> exit at Jct 11 and take the A33 towards Reading, making sure you are in the right
    hand lane, and follow the signs onto the B3031 towards Whitley. Cross over the roundabout, then after
    0.4 miles turn right into Hartland Rd. At the next roundabout turn left into Northumberland Avenue,
    and the ground is 120m on the left, just before the 2nd pelican crossing.</p>
    <p>If the car park is full you can park in the Academy Sport car park opposite.</p>
    <p><b>By public transport</b> Reading Station is on the main 
    <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/PAD/RDG/saturday/1240/arr">London Paddington</a> to
    <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/Bristol/RDG/saturday/1240/arr">Bristol</a> line,
    as well as many cross country routes. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reading-buses.co.uk/">emerald 5 bus</a>
    runs from the station to right outside the ground, and runs every 10 minutes, taking just over 15 minutes.
    For fares see <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reading-buses.co.uk/on-the-bus-fares">Reading Buses</a>
    (and note if you are paying by cash you need exact fare), and also remember you
    can get <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.plusbus.info/reading">Plusbus</a> when buying your rail ticket.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> You can use contactless (not Oyster) to travel to Reading from London, however for certain return journeys this may be more expensive than buying a paper ticket. Please check <a rel="nofollow" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/find-fares/tube-and-rail-fares/single-fare-finder">TFL single fare finder</a> vs <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">National Rail</a> before travelling.</p>
    <p>Exit the station on the south side, and head straight past the busy taxi rank (a taxi to the
    ground is probably worth it if there are more than two of you) into Station Road (with the no entry sign)
    to Stop SC. Take the 5 bus towards Northumberland Avenue to the Hartland Road stop; the buses are modern and
    do have the Next Stop Announcement System. The ground is 80 yds back up the road, on the opposite side.</p>
    <p>If you go to the Victoria Cross after the game, the 6 and 7 buses run to Reading Station from outside the pub.</p>

    mini-roundabouts onto Carshalton Road and the ground is on your left shortly after entering Woodmansterne
    village.</p>
    <p><b>Via Public Transport</b> The club is 250m from the Merrymeet stop on the
    <a rel="nofollow" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/bus/route/166/?direction=inbound">166 bus route</a>,
    which run every 20 minutes from West Croydon to Epsom. From the stop follow the road towards
    Banstead (which is straight on if coming from Croydon, or back up the road if coming from
    Epsom/Banstead), and the club will be on your right.</p>
    <p>If you are coming from London the quickest route is to get the train to
    <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/London/WME/saturday/1245/arr">Woodmansterne Station</a>,
    walk down the road to the main road, and you'll see the
    <a rel="nofollow" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/bus/stop/490001342B/woodmansterne-station">166 bus stop</a>
    on the opposite side of the road. The bus should take about 8 minutes. You might also be tempted to walk from
	the station via Alexander Ave, Whitethorn Ave and Richland Ave, which comes in to the back of the ground, and while this is
	possible it is not advised as the hill is extremely steep, and rises 170 feet. Of course this does mean
	that the walk down to the station after a game is a very easy walk.</p>
    <p>Trains to Woodmansterne only run every half hour, and there is no taxi
    rank there, so it can be quicker to go via 
    <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/London/PUR/saturday/1245/arr">Purley Station</a>
    which has 8 fast trains an hour from London, and where there is a busy taxi rank
    right in front of the station.</p>
    <p>To get to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/bus/stop/490011259G/purley-downlands-precinct?lineId=166">166 bus stop</a>
    turn right out of the station car park, immediately left down the path before the
    multi-storey car park, at the road turn right, then immediately after the zebra
    crossing turn left down the path onto the main road, and the bus stop is right there.
    The bus should take about 21 minutes.</p>
